# Tuulituhohaukka APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This readme covers the most used commands, but you can read more about create react app to find other functionality available in this project.

To start developing the app, you need to first install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Devcontainer

This application uses VSCode devcontainers to normalize the development environment. The project may however be developed and built also without devcontainers. However using the devcontainer guarantees that every developer is using the same development and build environment.

You can read more about devcontainers [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Running in development mode

You can run the development server via npm. This will start the server and any changes to the code will be hot deployed into the browser. The process will open a browser window pointing to the development server automatically.

`npm start`

## Building the application

Building the application will combine all necessary javascript dependencies and build a static version of the tool. The results will be in the `build/` folder:

`npm run build`
